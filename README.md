**Prediction of Heart Disease: Decision Tree Models**

**Overview**

The project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease based on various medical variables such as age, sex, and cholesterol level. Decision tree models are employed for this classification task, exploring both basic and hyperparameter-tuned versions.

**Objectives**

- Model Development: Implement decision tree models to predict the likelihood of heart disease using medical data.
- Comparison: Compare the performance of decision tree models with and without hyperparameter tuning.
- Feature Importance: Analyze the importance of different variables (age, sex, cholesterol level, etc.) in predicting heart disease.

**Dataset**

The dataset includes medical attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol level, and other relevant factors, along with the target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

**Key Components**

Code: Implementation of decision tree models in Python, with separate scripts for basic and hyperparameter-tuned versions.

Data: The dataset used for training and evaluating the models.

Documentation: Detailed explanation of the steps performed.
